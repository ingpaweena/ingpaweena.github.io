I'm looking to break into a positive and dynamic retail environment coming from a strong background in warehouse operations for logistics and last mile delivery.
I'm also experienced in managing people from my work at Mount Diablo Unified School District and
 raising several children. If you have any questions about my work or career plans, I'm very responsive to <a href="mailto:ingpaweena@gmail.com">email</a>. 

Interests
======
I'm generally interested in eating well, exploring different cooking styles, and thinking about how to be healthy. 

Other Interests
======
In my spare time I like to go camping and lift heavy.
